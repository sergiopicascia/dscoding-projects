    "Hello! ✨ The Quiz ✨ project is a simple project powered by IMDb movie data. The goal is very simple: Besides getting the best possible grade 👀, the goal is to create a quiz of 10 movie-related questions. With each correct answer, players earn points according to the difficiulty level they chose. Throughout this notebook, I'll explain how I made that possible. \n",
